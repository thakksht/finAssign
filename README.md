## Known Issues

### ⚠️ Deployment Error
**IMPORTANT**: The application cannot currently be deployed due to a type error in the API routes that couldn't be fully resolved within the time constraints. 

**Details**:
- Issue occurs specifically in the transactions API endpoint (`src/app/api/transactions/[id]/route.ts`)
- The error relates to type definitions for dynamic route parameters in Next.js 15.3.3 App Router
- The error causes build failures in the production environment despite working correctly in development mode
- Despite multiple attempts at fixing the typing issue, a complete solution couldn't be implemented within the project timeframe

While all features of the application function correctly in development mode, this specific type error prevents successful deployment to production environments.

## Implementation Notes

This project successfully implements all the required features with additional enhancements:

1. **Transaction Management**: Complete CRUD operations, filtering, and validation
2. **Categorization System**: Dynamic categories with color coding and auto-categorization
3. **Dashboard Visualization**: 
   - Enhanced pie chart with better tooltips, animations, and legend formatting
   - Category details component showing top spending categories
   - Uncategorized transactions alert
   - Monthly summaries with spending insights
4. **Budget Tracking**: Budget vs. actual spending comparison charts
5. **Code Structure**: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns

Despite the deployment error, all functionality works correctly in the development environment, delivering a complete and polished user experience.
